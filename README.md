Description
------

Multiagent system technology is a promising new venue 
for interactive musical performance. 

In recent works, this technology has been tailored to solve 
speciÔ¨Åc, limited scope musical problems, such as pulse detection, 
instrument simulation or automatic accompaniment. 

We present an implementation of a computational framework that 
subsumes previous works and addresses general-interest low-level 
problems such as real-time synchronization, sound communication 
and spatial agent mobility. 

By using it, a user may develop a musical multiagent system 
focusing primarily in his/her musical needs, while leaving 
most of the technical problems to the framework.
